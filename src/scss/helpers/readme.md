# SCSS Helpers Readme
The helpers folder should only contain scss that helps write css. Never includable CSS files.


## What should be included
Utilities such as:

* functions
* loops
* mixins
* anything that outputs CSS but is not includable in files


### Examples
Do not prefix the files here. ie. underscores like _filename.scss

* mixins.scss
* loops.scss
